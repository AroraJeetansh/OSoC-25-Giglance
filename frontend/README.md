### 🚀 What is Giglance?

Giglance is an open-source platform designed to simulate the development of a high-quality, production-grade freelancing marketplace. But more than just a product, **Giglance is an engineering bootcamp disguised as a project**.

Whether you're a beginner in backend APIs, a frontend enthusiast, or a DevOps learner — **Giglance welcomes you to contribute, learn real-world development practices, and collaborate on building something meaningful.**

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Engineering Practices

This project strictly follows **real-world software development workflows**, enabling contributors to gain exposure to industry-grade practices such as:

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All backend contributions require test cases before implementation, giving you deep exposure to writing maintainable and testable code.
* **Pull Request Reviews:** Each PR is linked to a GitHub issue, reviewed systematically, and validated with automation — just like in professional teams.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Our GitHub workflows enforce commit hygiene, PR structure, backend test automation, and integration checks — preparing you for DevOps readiness.
* **Agile Methodology:** Work is organized using Kanban boards, issue templates, and label-driven task assignment. You'll learn how to operate in sprints, pick up issues by difficulty, and understand project velocity.
* **API Contracts & Schema Validation:** Backend APIs follow strict schemas and are tested with robust validations, teaching you how to design clean, predictable interfaces.
* **Structured Git Workflows:** Branching conventions, semantic commits, and protected merges simulate enterprise-grade Git strategies.
* **Preview Environments:** Contributors working on UI get live feedback with preview deployments, mimicking real product teams and stakeholder reviews.
