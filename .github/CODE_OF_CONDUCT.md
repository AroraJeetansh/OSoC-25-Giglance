# Giglance - Contributors Code of Conduct

Welcome to Giglance, where we're turning contributors into confident developers! This document outlines the expectations for participation in our community and how we assign issues to contributors.

## ‚ùå You'll never get issue assigned

- "I want to work on this issue please assign it to me, I'll make UI better"

- "Please assign me any issue, I need to contribute"

- "I'm interested in this issue. Please assign."

## ‚úÖ You'll easily get issue assigned

- "Hi, I've examined this pagination bug and found the root cause in the React Query dependency array. I can implement a fix with proper error handling within 2 days."

- "I noticed the navbar has responsiveness issues on mobile devices. I've created a quick prototype showing my solution here: <_link_>. I'd like to implement this if you agree with the approach. My ETA is 3 days."

- "For this API endpoint issue, I've reviewed the current implementation and see that we're missing proper validation. I can add Zod schemas and integration tests within 4 days."

## üí° Pro tips from the Project Mentor

- I'm excited to help you become a confident developer, not just a contributor. The minimum I expect is genuine interest in learning and growing.

- Want quick assignments without learning? This isn't the project for you. Want to master modern web development practices while building something real? Welcome home.

- I'm always available to help anyone who genuinely wants to learn. **But please don't spam dozens of projects with copy-paste messages** - focus on 2-3 projects you're truly interested in.

- Can't find an issue that matches your skills? Join our Discord. I'll personally help you find something that helps you grow.

- Happy learning! Giglance exists to transform you from a contributor into a confident developer.

## For those who have time to read below

### Issue Assignment Process

- **Preparation**: Before requesting assignment, thoroughly investigate the issue. Read the codebase, understand the problem, and think about potential solutions.

- **ETA**: Always provide a realistic estimated time of completion. We understand things come up, but setting expectations helps everyone.

- **Approach**: Briefly describe how you plan to solve the issue. This shows you've thought it through and have a clear direction.

### Communication Standards

- **Expression of Interest**: Demonstrate your understanding of the issue and readiness to tackle it. "Please assign" without context shows lack of preparation.

- **Status Updates**: If you're assigned an issue but encounter delays, communicate early and often. We'd rather know you need more time than wonder if you've abandoned the work.

- **Questions**: Ask specific, well-researched questions when stuck. "I'm stuck" is less helpful than "I'm trying to implement X using Y approach, but encountering Z error."

### Restrictions

- **AI-Generated Content**: Using AI to generate PR descriptions without understanding them is strongly discouraged, feel free to use AI for development purposes, but pushing untested code or unsafe AI generated code to production is yet again strongly discouraged.

- **Issues**: The best contributors first help clear the backlog than moving formward blindly.

- **PR Template**: Please follow the PR template, not following it will result in an automatic closing of the PR.

- **Testing**: Please make sure all your code that you push for the review has been tested thoroughly and make sure to follow all guidelines.

We have an automated workflow for testing, type-checking and PR template checks, not following them may result in an automatic PR close

### Learning Focus

Giglance exists to help you learn professional development practices. We prioritize:

- Test-driven development
- Agile Development Principles
- Clean code principles
- Proper Git workflows
- Code review processes

Your growth as a developer is our primary goal. Every issue you solve should teach you something new.
